# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 14, 2019 

**Today's Progress & Thoughts**: I uploaded some of my recent work on GitHub and startef the challenge. I am motivated and want to use this format to dive into Java, starting by doing the Uni Helsinki MOOC. I will go through the exercises and push my solutions to a repository here on GitHub. Also read SICP chapter 1.1 again.
